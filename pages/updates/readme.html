<p>The first tiny project also made it to this page. It is a simple project to automatically stop a water outlet if a canister is full. The project was used as a protoype for building this page and you can find it here: <a href="#/pages/projects/automatic_canister_filling/readme.html">Automatic Canister Filling</a>.</p>

<p>I found some time to publish this web page and registered a domain for it. The page is built with simple HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is hosted on GitHub and you can find it here: <a href="https://github.com/lm4552/lm4552.github.io">lm4552.github.io Repository</a>. Contents for the projects are inlcuded by using the repositories as Git submodules.</p>
