#### Welcome to my personal web page!

My name is Loris and I study Computer Engineering. 
Not only because of that am I interested in various topics around computers and electronics.

In my freetime I sometimes work on smaller hardware and software projects.
As a result I build this small page to display some of them. 
However, not all of my projects make it to this page.
I typically get ideas of what I want to build next when spending time on my other hobbies.

As you can see in some of my projects, I like to keep fish and the idea of aquascaping.
When I'm on the move, I'm probably snowboarding in the mountains with friends or family.
Of course taking pictures is a part of these activities.

If you've read until here, you can as well leave me a message an tell me what you think about this little page.
