Welcome to my personal web page!

<p>My name is Loris and I study Computer Engineering. Not only because of that am I interested in various topics around computers and electronics.</p>
<p>In my freetime I sometimes work on smaller hardware and software <a href="#/pages/projects/readme.html">projects</a>. As a result I built this small page to display some of them. However, not all of my projects make it to this page. I typically get ideas of what I want to build next when spending time on my other hobbies.</p>
<p>As you can see in some of my projects, I like to keep fish and the idea of aquascaping. When I’m on the move, I’m probably snowboarding in the mountains with friends or family. Of course taking <a href="#/pages/gallery/readme.html">pictures</a> is a part of these activities.</p>
<p>If you’ve read this far, you can as well leave me a message and tell me what you think about this little page.</p>
