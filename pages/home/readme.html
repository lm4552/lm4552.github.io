<h4 id="welcome-to-my-personal-web-page">Welcome to my personal web page!</h4>
<p>My name is Loris and I study Computer Engineering. Not only because of that am I interested in various topics around computers and electronics.</p>
<p>In my freetime I sometimes work on smaller hardware and software projects. As a result I build this small page to display some of them. However, not all of my projects make it to this page. I typically get ideas of what I want to build next when spending time on my other hobbies.</p>
<p>As you can see in some of my projects, I like to keep fish and the idea of aquascaping. When I’m on the move, I’m probably snowboarding in the mountains with friends or family. Of course taking pictures is a part of these activities.</p>
<p>If you’ve read until here, you can as well leave me a message an tell me what you think about this little page.</p>
